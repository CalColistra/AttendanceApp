This project’s primary goal is to allow students to submit their attendance using their student ID cards and an RFID reader. It will save professors a lot of time at the beginning of their classes and eliminate the possibility of the professor mismarking the students’ attendance. The project also includes a web application to track each student's attendance. The web application will make it easier for professors to access their student's attendance. It will also allow students to search their classes to check their attendance grades. Alternative to using a paper sign-in sheet and running the risk of losing it or students forgetting to sign it, professors can use this project to track their student's attendance more effectively.
